There's a new premium tier and it's called the NewsBlur Premium Archive subscription. For $99/year, every story from every site you subscribe to will stay in NewsBlur's archive. This premium tier also allows you to mark any story as unread as well as choose when stories are automatically marked as read. You can now have full control of your story archive, letting you search, share, and read stories forever without having to worry about them being deleted.

The Premium Archive subscription offers you the following:

 * <img src="/assets/icons8/icons8-filing-cabinet-100.png" style="width: 16px;margin: 0 6px 0 0;display: inline-block;"> Every story from every site is archived and searchable forever

The launch of this new subscription tier also includes the 2022 redesign, which includes a new dashboard and a whole lot of new icons.

The latest redesign style has more accomodations for spacing and padding around each story title element. The result is a cleaner story title with easier to read headlines. The author has been moved and restyled to be next to the story date. Favicons and unread status indicators have been swapped, and font sizes, colors, and weights have been adjusted.

The compact interface is denser than before, giving power users a highly detailed view. Transitions have also been added to help you feel the difference.

If you find the interface to be too airy, there is a setting in the main Manage menu allowing you to switch between Comfortable and Compact. Notice all of those new icons.
