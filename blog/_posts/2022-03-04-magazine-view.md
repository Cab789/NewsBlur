Here's a nice new feature that brings a new perspective to your stories. It's called the Magazine view and you can access it next to the other story views:

Loads of new features:

 * The dashboard now has multiple, customizable rivers of news
 * Image previews are now customizable by size and layout
 * Story previews are also customizable by length
 * Images are now full bleed on the web (edge-to-edge)
 * Controls have been re-styled and made more accessible
 * Sizes, spaces, and text have all been tweaked for a more legible read
 * Upgraded backend: Python 2 to Python 3, latest Django and libraries, containerized infrastructure
 * Both Android and iOS apps have been updated with the new design
